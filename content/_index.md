# Pulse User Guide

## What is Pulse?

Pulse integrates technology and methodology to enable rapid, dynamic, mission-focused engagement with indigenous communities and individuals at the edges of communication and society. Pulse enables analysis of a target audience, their communications habits and technologies, and then rapidly configures a system for two-way communication across numerous channels (e.g., Short Message System (SMS), Multi-media Message System (MMS), Interactive Voice Response (IVR), “paper-to-digital”, etc.).

Pulse is designed to enable the user from campaign design through Measure of Effectiveness (MOE) analysis, featuring simultaneous campaign launches and feedback collection across integrated communications modalities. The operator can access Pulse through the Pulse User Interface (PUI) on the web from laptop, desktop, or android devices to design, launch, monitor, and analyze any number of information campaigns - launching integrated collection across multiple modalities and tracking results in a single, consistent data structure on the back end to receive, normalize and visualize collected information.

Pulse has been tested and refined through deployment in a variety of communities and domains in support of missions around the world for a variety of stakeholders. This document serves as a guide for new users on the Pulse platform and its components.
